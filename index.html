  <h2>After a childhood spent listening to Mozart and other classical giants, Amel fell head over heels in love with the piano. Her pursuit of music has taken her around the globe but started with music lessons at the Cantata Institute of Music in Jakarta. Amel has since studied piano pedagogy at both the University of Northern Iowa and the University of North Carolina School of the Arts where she received her Bachelor of Music degree in Piano Performance. During her studies, she received many accolades including the “UNI Concerto Competition Audience Favorite” award and the highest honors from the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. She also participated in UNI’s Women's Choir, performed in Ireland and performed with the orchestra in a memorable Leonard Bernstein production at UNCSA. She is now completing her Master’s degree at Temple University’s Boyer College of Music and continuing to collaborate with other instrumentalists in chamber music productions throughout Philadelphia. When she’s not playing piano, Amel enjoys biking around the area and joining friends for some butter pecan ice cream.</h2>
